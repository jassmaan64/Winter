Sources used were geeks for geeks, stack overflow and chatGpt. The sources were used to help with the getting the syntax down and understand the inner workings of the code. The sources helped me understand the innerworkings of prolog and confirm any rules that I might be breaking if any with prolog. The references did not interfere with my understanding in any way as it helped me learn how exactly prolog logic would work and I also researched some prolog functions to see how they work.
