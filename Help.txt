Sources used were geeks for geeks, stack overflow and chatGpt. The sources were used to help with the getting the type declarations down as they were somewhat hard to figure out at first especially eq an and rod a as I did not know what they meant. The sources helped me understand the type declarations, what they mean, also understanding what a helper function was. The references did not interfere with my understanding in any way as it helped me learn what those declarations were and also understand what a helper function is enhancing my learning.
