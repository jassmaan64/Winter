Sources used were chatGpt and another student from class. The sources were used to help with the getting the syntax down. The sources helped me understand the inner-workings of differences between erlang and Haskell. Also to confirm any rules that I might be breaking if any with erlang. The references did not interfere with my understanding in any way as it helped me learn how exactly erlang logic would work.
